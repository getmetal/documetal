## Generate API Keys (`apiKey` + `clientId`)

Navigate to the [Org Settings page](https://app.getmetal.io/settings/organization) to generate an API Key:

Immeditely upon creation, you'll receive an `apiKey`. Make sure to store this somewhere safe, as you won't be able to access it after navigating away.
After returning to the list page, you'll be able to see the `clientId`for each API Key.
