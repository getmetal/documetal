## Overview
Attribute Extraction is the process of identifying specific information within unstructured data and converting it into a structured format. It scans Datasources, isolates particular pieces of information, and presents them in a structured manner.

## Usage

### Add Datasource

Create a datasource by calling the [Add datasource endpoint]('https://docs.getmetal.io/rest-api/datasources/create') to define the field attributes to extract. Use the description parameter to guide the LLM.

### Get Datasource

Get the datasource by calling the [Get datasource endpoint]('https://docs.getmetal.io/rest-api/datasources/get-one'). This will return the datasource with the corresponding id.

### File Uploading ([Add Data Entities](https://docs.getmetal.io/rest-api/dataentities/create))

We support the following file types for Attribute Extraction:
- `.pdf`
- `.csv`
- `.docx`
- `.xlsx`

Upon upload, these files run through the following pipeline:
1. File is converted into a text representation via OCR (if applicable)
2. The text runs through a series of metadata extractors + augmenters
3. Attributes are stored in our database and ready to use in your indexes.
