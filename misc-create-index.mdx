## Creating a Metal Index (`indexId`)

Log into your [Metal Account](https://app.getmetal.io/login) to get started.<br />
First, we'll want to create an Index within the [Metal Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io). Eg:
![Create App](/images/create-index.png)

After creation, you should be able to access the Index Dashboard:
![App Dashboard](/images/index-dashboard.png)

Note: You can find the `indexId` in the URL while on the Index Dashboard page.
