## Product Limits
Metal has usage limits in place at each payment plan. These limits are applied on a per-org basis. If you exceed the usage limit, you'll receive a `422` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 422,
  "message": "<feature> limit reached"
}
```

### Product Limits by Plan

| Limit | Hobbyist | Developer | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Embeddings | 100k | 1M | custom |
| Files | 100 | 500 | custom |
| Indexes | 2 | 10 | custom |
| Jobs | 10 | 100 | custom |
| Memories | 1k | 1k | custom |
| Users | 1 | 3 | custom |



## Rate Limits
Metal has rate limits in place to ensure the stability of the API. These limits are applied on a per-minute basis. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded, retry in 1 minute"
}
```

### Rate Limits by Plan

| Plan | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hobbyist | 300 RPM |
| Developer | 1,000 RPM |
| Enterprise | 1k+ RPM |


## Index Archiving

After 30 days of inactivity in an index, the index will be automatically `ARCHIVED`. Archived indexes aren't able to be searched, in order to reactivate them they need to be updated using the Index Update API with `status: "UNARCHIVED"`.

### Index Statuses

`LIVE` : Index is ready to use

`ARCHIVED`: Archived 30 days of inactivity (no search, no indexing)

`UNARCHIVED`: Ready to reindex and migrate to Live

`REINDEXING` : In the process of reindexing

`DEACTIVATING`: In the process of archiving
