## Creating a Data Source

Log into your [Metal Account](https://app.getmetal.io/login) to get started.<br />

Navigate to the [Data Source](https://app.getmetal.io/datasources) page and add a Data Source specifying the attributes to extract. Use the description box to guide the LLM.

Next upload your file (pdf, docx, or csv) and stand by for the extracted results. Note you can add multiple files to the same Datasource.

Now you can integrate your structured data into Metal indexes or opt to download it.
