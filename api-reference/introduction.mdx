## Base URL
The Metal API is available at the following URL:

```
https://api.getmetal.io
```

## Authentication
Metal uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Metal Application](https://app.getmetal.io/settings/organization). There are two headers that you'll retrieve from each Key.

### API Key Headers
| Title | Header | Example Key
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API Key | `x-metal-api-key` | `pk_1234567890` |
| Client ID | `x-metal-client-id` | `ci_1234567890` |


### Example Authenticated Request
```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.getmetal.io' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-metal-api-key: pk_1234567890' \
--header 'x-metal-client-id: ci_1234567890' \

```

## Rate Limits
Metal has rate limits in place to ensure the stability of the API. These limits are applied on a per-minute basis. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded, retry in 1 minute"
}
```

### Rate Limits by Plan

| Plan | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hobbyist | 300 RPM |
| Developer | 1,000 RPM |
| Enterprise | 1k+ RPM |

## Feature Usage Limits
Metal has usage limits in place at each payment plan. These limits are applied on a per-org basis. If you exceed the usage limit, you'll receive a `422` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 422,
  "message": "<feature> limit reached"
}
```

### Feature Usage Limits by Plan

| Limit | Hobbyist | Developer | Enterprise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Embeddings | 100k | 1M | custom |
| Files | 100 | 500 | custom |
| Indexes | 2 | 10 | custom |
| Jobs | 10 | 100 | custom |
| Memories | 1k | 1k | custom |
| Users | 1 | 3 | custom |

## Response Codes
Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Metal's servers.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | OK - Everything worked as expected. |
| 400 | Bad Request - Often missing a required parameter. |
| 401 | Unauthorized - No valid API key provided. |
| 402 | Request Failed - Parameters were valid but request failed. |
| 404 | Not Found - The requested item doesn't exist. |
| 422 | Usage Limit Exceeded - Hit a feature or usage limit based on your plan.  |
| 429 | Rate Limit Exceeded - Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| 5xx | Server Errors - something went wrong on Metal's end. |

## Normal pagination
For certain endpoints, such as `/v1/indexes/:id/documents`, pagination can be achieved using the `page` and `limit` query parameters.

Both page and limit should be positive integers with a maximum value of 100. This constraint means that using this method, callers can retrieve a maximum of `10,000` (i.e., `100` * `100`) records.

## Deep pagination
To fetch documents beyond the limitations of normal pagination, you should utilize the `lastObjectIdSeen` value returned. This ID enables the API to access data from a deeper point in the dataset. Below is an illustrative script to demonstrate this approach:

```js
const fetchAllDocuments = () => {
  do {
    try {
      const response = await axios
        .get('https://api.getmetal.io/indexes/<indexID>/documents', {
          headers: {
            'x-metal-api-key': '<your_key>',
            'x-metal-client-id': '<your_client_id>',
          },
          params: {
            lt: lastSeenObjectId, // this will be a querystring parameter `lt=${lastSeenObjectId}`
            limit: 100,
          },
        });

      documents = documents.concat(response.data.data);

      lastSeenObjectId = response.data.lastSeenObjectId;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching documents:', error);
      break;
    }
  } while (lastSeenObjectId);

  return documents;
}
```
