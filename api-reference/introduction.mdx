## Base URL
The Metal API is available at the following URL:

```
https://api.getmetal.io
```

## Authentication
Metal uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Metal Application](https://app.getmetal.io/settings/organization). There are two headers that you'll retrieve from each Key.

### API Key Headers
| Title | Header | Example Key
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API Key | `x-metal-api-key` | `pk_1234567890` |
| Client ID | `x-metal-client-id` | `ci_1234567890` |


### Example Authenticated Request
```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.getmetal.io \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-metal-api-key: pk_1234567890' \
--header 'x-metal-client-id: ci_1234567890' \
```

## Rate Limits
Metal has rate limits in place to ensure the stability of the API. These limits are applied on a per-minute basis. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the following body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
   "error": "Too Many Requests",
   "message": "Rate limit exceeded, retry in 1 minute"
}
```

### Plan Limits

| Plan | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hobbyist | 300 RPM |
| Developer | 1,000 RPM |
| Enterprise | 1k+ RPM |

## Response Codes
Metal uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Metal's servers.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | OK - Everything worked as expected. |
| 400 | Bad Request - Often missing a required parameter. |
| 401 | Unauthorized - No valid API key provided. |
| 402 | Request Failed - Parameters were valid but request failed. |
| 404 | Not Found - The requested item doesn't exist. |
| 429 | Rate Limit Exceeded - Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| 5xx | Server Errors - something went wrong on Metal's end. |
