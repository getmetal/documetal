## Base URL
The Metal API is available at the following URL:

```
https://api.getmetal.io
```

## Authentication
Metal uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Metal Application](https://app.getmetal.io/settings/organization). There are two headers that you'll retrieve from each Key:

#### API Key
```
x-metal-api-key: pk_1234567890
```

#### Client ID
```
x-metal-client-id: ci_1234567890
```
