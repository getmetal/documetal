## Motorhead

Motorhead is an open source memory and information retrieval server for LLMs. Written in Rust.

`session` ids can be provided to the server to keep track of the chat history (short-term memory) of a user. This is useful for chatbots, where the user's chat history is important for context management. Once a certain amount of messages have been created, the Motorhead will automatically summarize older messages into an incremental context. This context can be used to retrieve information from the user's long-term memory.

Additionally, messages are vectorized and indexed for retrieval.
