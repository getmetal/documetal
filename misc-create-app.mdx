## Creating a Metal App (`appId`)

Log into your [Metal Account](https://app.getmetal.io/login) to get started.<br />
First, we'll want to create an App within the [Metal Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io). Eg:
![Create App](/images/create-app.png)

After creation, you should be able to access the App Dashboard:
![App Dashboard](/images/app-dash.png)

Note: You can find the `appId` in the URL while on the App Dashboard page.
