At a high level, Metal provides developers with a toolset for easily building LLM capabilities into their applications. This is broken out into two products:

- **Retrieval:** Make your data compatible with your AI products.
- **Memory:** Give your AI products the ability to remember & learn over time.

Together, these products enable developers to leverage the full power of LLMs into their applications.

## ðŸ”’ Enterprise Grade
Metal is built for production. Our system is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. LLMs are computationally expensive, so we've built our system to be highly performant and cost effective.
