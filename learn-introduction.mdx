![Metal Overview](/images/metal-high-level.png)

Metal provides developers with powerful tooling to easily build high powered data ingestion and data retrieval pipelines in order to get the most out of your data and LLMs.

- **Ingestion Pipeline:** Ingest data from any source, in any format, at any scale.
- **Retrieval Engine:** Query your data for usage with LLMs.

## ðŸ”’ Enterprise Grade
Metal is built for production. Our system is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. LLMs are computationally expensive, so we've built our system to be highly performant and cost effective.
