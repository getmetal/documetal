| Indexing  | Pushing data (raw text, documents, images, etc) into our system. |
| Searching | An operation to run semantic searches on your index.             |
| Tuning    | A mechanism to fine-tune your _App_ programatically.             |

## Indexing

You can index various types of data into our system. We support the following data types:

- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff)
- Raw Text (plain text)

Checkout our [Indexing Embeddings](/api-reference/embeddings/post) endpoint for more details.

## Searching

You can run semantic searches on your embedded data in a number of ways. We support the following search term types:

- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff)
- Raw Text (plain text)

Checkout our [Search](/api-reference/embeddings/search) endpoint for more details.

## Tuning

We offer a tuning mechanism to programatically improve the quality of your search results.
By labeling your data with the tune endpoint, you can improve the accuracy of your data by
generated custom embeddings for your specific use case.
