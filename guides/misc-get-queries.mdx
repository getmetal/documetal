## Overview

Metal provides a way to analyze user queries and understand how users interact with your application.
This is done by accesing the `Analytics` tab in your [application dashboard.](https://app.getmetal.io)

You can also access the queries via the [Metal API](http://localhost:3000/rest-api/analytics/get-queries).



<CodeGroup>
```python Python
metal.get_queries("index_id")
```

```javascript Node
const queries = await metal.getQueries("index-id");
```

</CodeGroup>


The response will be an array of objects, each representing a query.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "t": "2023-08-30T11:34:35.128Z",
      "d": 0.176956892014,
      "q": "Who is the best drummer of all time?"
      },
    {
      "t": "2023-08-29T11:34:18.099Z",
      "d": 0.156819581985,
      "q": "Which band is represented by the iconic mascot Eddie?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
- t: Timestamp of the query
- d: Cosine distance between the search query and the retrieved embedding. A smaller value indicates a closer match.
- q: Actual user query
