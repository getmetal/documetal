Identify and retrieve specific pieces of information from unstructured data and transform them into a structured format.
This is useful for extracting information from documents such as invoices, receipts, and contracts.
Begin by creating a Datasource and specifying the attributes to extract. Then upload a Data Entity (pdf, docx, or csv) and stand by for the extracted results.

## 1. Add a Datasource

Log into your [Metal Account](https://app.getmetal.io/login) to get started.<br />

Navigate to the [Datasource](https://app.getmetal.io/datasources) page and add a Datasource specifying the attributes to extract. Use the description box to guide the LLM.

## 2. Add a Data Entity
Next create a Data Entity by uploading a file (pdf, docx, or csv) and stand by for the extracted results. Note you can add multiple Data Entities to the same Datasource.
