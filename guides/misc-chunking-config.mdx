## What is Chunking?

Chunking breaks documents into smaller sections when they are indexed.
This process not only enhances the performance of retrieval engines but also
allows for more efficient searches within concise text. Additionally, it overcomes
 token size restrictions in language models. Given that these models have a set token
 limit for each input, dividing the text ensures it stays within this constraint.


## How to Configure Chunking?

Navigate to your [Metal Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io/), create an Index and select the `Chunking` options:

Chunk configuration is composed of two parameters:
- Chunk Size: The maximum number of tokens per chunk.
- Overlap Size: The number of tokens that overlap between chunks. This is useful for
  ensuring that the context of the chunk is preserved. We recommend starting with an overlap of approximately 10% of the `Chunk Size`.
