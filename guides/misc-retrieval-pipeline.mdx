description: Build a LLM retrieval pipeline with Metal (RAG)

## 1. Create a Datasource

A Datasource is the collection of files that need to be preprocessed to feed our application.
To start, go to your organization [Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io), navigate to the Datasources tab, and click on the `Add Datasource` button to create a new Datasource.

## 2. Add an Index and Connect it to a Datasource

Indexes are where your preprocessed data will be transformed and made queryable for your application.
To set up an Index, go to the Indexes tab, and click on the `Add Index` button to create a new Index.
You can then connect your Index to the existing Datasource.

## 3. Add Files to your Datasource

Go to the Datasource tab, and click on the `Upload File` button to upload your files.
Accepted file formats are PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLSX, and CSV. This will now become `Data Entities`.

After you've added a file, Metal preprocess the data, create the chunks and generate the embeddings that will be used for retrieval.
