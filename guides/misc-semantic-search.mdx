## 1. Create an App

Go to your organization [Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io) and start by creating a new App. Give it a name and select type: Search.

## 2. Connect to Datasource

A Datasource is a collection of data that will feed your app. You can add multiple files or Data Entities to a Datasource.
Connect your app to an existing Datasource or create a new one.

## 3. Add Data Entities

A Data Entity is a single file or entry in a Datasource. Accepted file formats are PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLSX, and CSV.

After you've added a Data Entity, Metal will create an Index, process the data into chunks, and generate the embeddings that will be used to match the user's query to the most relevant documents.

## 4. Query your Search Engine

Once the data is processed, you can query your app using the search bar in the UI or using search() via the API.
Metal will return the most relevant documents based on the user's query.
