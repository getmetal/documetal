## 1. Create an App

Go to your organization [Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io) and start by creating a new App. Give it a name and select type: Chatbot.

## 2. Connect to Datasource

A Datasource is a collection of data that will feed your app. You can add multiple files or Data Entities to a Datasource.
Connect your app to an existing Datasource or create a new one.

## 3. Add Data Entities

A Data Entity is a single file or entry in a Datasource. Accepted file formats are PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLSX, and CSV.

After you've added a Data Entity, Metal will create an Index, process the data into chunks, and generate the embeddings that will be used to match the user's input to the right response.

## 4. Deploy your Chatbot

Try out your chatbot with Metal's open source [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/getmetal/chatbot).
Start by cloning the repo and following the instructions in the README.
You'll need to add Open AI `API Key`, and Metal's `API key`, `Client Id` and `Index Id` to the `.env.local file`.
