## Adding a Metal Index (`indexId`)

Log into your [Metal Account](https://app.getmetal.io/login) to get started.<br />
First, we'll want to create an Index within the [Metal Dashboard](https://app.getmetal.io). Eg:

After creation, you should be able to access the Index Dashboard:

Note: You can find the `indexId` in the settings of your Index Dashboard.
